this is a readme as a guide to run result
 -> note : some different IDE maybe will affect different since there's a plugin that doesnt support
 -> ID success tested on PYCharm

 since there's a three part for this test. here's i list named of file for every part
 -->part 1 : basic_python.py
 - i write all all the quize for the first part here.
 - you can test basic python by running it in python

--> part 2 : library_system.py
- i write library sistem part 2 in library_system.py with the requirement based on the test
- i also create a scenario to testing a part 2 you just need to run it and see the result

--> part 3 : database.py, database_manipulation, visualization.py
--> database.py :  is used for generate structure of database  if it success to run it will return nothing
    but it will return a file my_database.db
--> since we have database file named my_database.db, we can import it and we can do some manipulation queries
    to return neccessary. data i write all that case on database_manipulation.py
--> visualization.py : this is for visualize our data , you just need to run it and it will be generarte a diagram

in conclusion : all the file can be generate but running it first.
note : cause i generate a raw of data manually. once you have generate data base file if you want to generate it again
        you need to delete current my_database.db if it exist first, to prevent error due to duplicate data
